Matt Sagat - Personal Project, Command Terminal-Based Aim Trainer

FOR THE BEST UNDERSTANDING OF THIS NICHE PROJECCT, I STRONGLY RECCOMEND WATCHING THESE YOUTUBE VIDEOS BEFORE DIGGING THROUGH THIS REPOSITORY

This tool allows those in the Roblox RCL community to easily get aiming practice against bots in customizable environments. 

Full list of current features:
/set wall dist [num] --Sets the wall to be num studs from the center of the map (user spawn point).
/set wall color [color] --Changes the wall color to the user specified color.
/set cursor [cursor id] --Changes the user's cursor using a Roblox image asset ID.
/set bot quantity [num] --Updates the quantity of bots within the arena.
/acc --Prints the user's current accuracy into the terminal.
/resetacc --Resets the user's accuracy.

I personally wrote everything other than the code that positions the held gun in the user character's arms. I didn't even upload that file but it is not important.

Other considerations:
Bots always spawn within the current wall distance set.
There are upper and lower bounds to valid wall distances, with errors if you exceed the bounds.

Future ideas:
Allow loading of maps via terminal.
Create different bot dodging modes.
